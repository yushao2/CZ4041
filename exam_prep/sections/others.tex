\[\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP}+\text{FP}}\]

Precision is a metric that quantifies the number of correct positive predictions made.\\\\
Precision, therefore, calculates the \textbf{accuracy for the minority class}.\\\\
It is calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted positive examples divided by the total number of positive examples that were predicted.

\[\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP}+\text{FN}}\]

Recall is a metric that quantifies the number of correct positive predictions made out of all positive predictions that could have been made.\\\\
Unlike precision that only comments on the correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions, recall provides an indication of missed positive predictions.\\\\
In this way, recall provides some notion of the \textbf{coverage of the positive class}.
